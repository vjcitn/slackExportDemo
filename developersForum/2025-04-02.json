Easy fix and the rest was perfectly functional. Iteratively asking it to implement more methods and calculate internal invariants was fun, particularly invariants because those need to be updated on any mutating method and it’s easy to miss when coding manually.\n\nThe second attempt was to do something I had almost zero understanding of. I wanted a web app todo list with a hierarchical task structure, dependencies and automation. It produced a surprisingly decent initial product, but the second it broke and I didn’t have the technical skills to debug it became an unrecoverable mess. LLMs at this stage is not capable of effective debugging of its own code.\n\nSo the third attempt was this. I know that it’s absolutely possible in principle because we already have things like Rsamtools. I know that it shouldn’t be overly complex because the code in the Python bindings look quite simple. I had no idea how to actually build C code into a shared library to call with Rcpp. The biggest time sink was actually getting it all to compile on my ARM Mac. Minimap2 makes heavy use of SSE instructions from x86 and it took a lot of trial and error with the Makevars to get it to work. But it was great to have the LLM set up 95% of the code for me to focus on the hard problems. It also required that I had already wasted sufficient portions of my life dealing with compiler errors to resolve the issues that came up.\n\nOverall 8 out of 10 :robot_face: .
